## Overview

The Problem: With many thirsty people frequenting the UH Manoa Campus to quench their thirst, it is imperative that people have access to the best avaliable water source on campus. For all those times you don’t have a water bottle and aren’t willing to pay the price for bottled water. Or maybe you aren’t sure if the water fountains in POST are better then the water fountains at Sakamaki. We bring to you an innovative new app.

The Solution: Introducing Water Connoisseur, for the times you don’t have a water bottle and just need to know which water fountain is the best. Water Connoisseur is an app that allows users to review and find the best water fountains on campus.

For this app, there will be a way to organize and present different water fountains around the UH Manoa campus. There will be two roles, Users, who can login to review water fountains and submit requests to have water fountains added to the list of reviewable water fountains. Admins, who will be able to login and moderate the app as well as add water fountains to the reviewable list.

Users should also be able to rate other users reviews, with a like and dislike system. With inappropriate reviews being able to be removed by Admins.

There should also be a sorting system, with top rated water fountains being able to be found easily.
